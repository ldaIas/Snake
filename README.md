===TO PLAY===
Make sure you have java installed.
Download Snake.jar (if the icon isn't a cup of coffee, you don't have java).
Run Snake.jar.
Press any arrow key to start moving.

===CONFIGURATIONS===
Download settings.txt and put it in the same directory as Snake.jar.
It is configured as such:
50       <-----  Length of window. To get length in pixels, multiply by 20.
50       <-----  Height of window. To get height in pixels, multiply by 20.
10       <-----  Snake speed. Lower if you want to play slower, higher if you want to play faster.

The changes will take affect when you close and reopen the game.
